I've worked in IT for quite some time and have liked many facets of it, from being a freelance technician to becoming an IT support specialist.
I didn't get my own personal computer till I was approximately 16, first world problems:) But once I did, I quickly infected it with viruses, 
and attempting to repair it lead me down this route.


At the moment, I'm enrolled in Code Institute's QQI level 6 Diploma in Full Stack Software Development program.

I look forward to the journey ahead, check out my repository and see what I am up to!
