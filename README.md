The first time I knew I was meant to be in IT was when I successfully defragmented all my friend's laptops to help speed them up. Even though I'm reasonably young; back then every bit of computing power still mattered. I worked alongside Technicians during my summer holidays off from school as a kid. I became an IT Support Technician and have worked with multiple companies to improve customer retention and fix IT-related problems. 

During Covid19 I decided to revisit my education after experimenting with coding for a while I found I enjoyed problem-solving. A lot.

I got frustrated watching tutorials and found myself wandering in circles trying to learn with no proper guidance. I decided to find a suitable course of study and amazingly discovered Code Institue & I feel I am learning the way I need to. 

In January 2022 I participated in my first Hackathon. We came in 2nd place! I could not have wished for more motivation to succeed.

I will keep learning and building my knowledge to get where I need to be. My aspirations include completing a degree in Computer Science and hopefully getting a Masters degree also down the line. I am passionate about this area and will code every day to prove that. 

I'm currently working hard at completing my qualification with Code Institute. Please look at the technologies I use below & please feel free to explore my repositories.
